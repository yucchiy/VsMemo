# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VsMemo is a VS Code extension currently in early development (v0.0.1). The project follows standard VS Code extension structure with TypeScript compilation.

## Development Commands

- `npm run compile` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript output in `out/` directory
- `npm run watch` - Watch for changes and recompile automatically
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on the source code
- `npm run test` - Run the extension tests (includes compile and lint steps)
- `npm run vscode:prepublish` - Prepare for publishing (runs compile)

## Project Structure

- `src/extension.ts` - Main extension entry point with activation/deactivation logic
- `src/test/extension.test.ts` - Extension test suite using Mocha
- `out/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by TypeScript compiler)
- `package.json` - Extension manifest defining commands and metadata

## Architecture

The extension uses the standard VS Code extension pattern:
- `activate()` function registers commands and is called when extension loads
- Commands are defined in `package.json` and implemented in `extension.ts`
- Currently implements a single "Hello World" command (`vsmemo.helloWorld`)

## TypeScript Configuration

- Target: ES2022
- Module: Node16
- Strict mode enabled
- Source maps generated for debugging
- Output directory: `out/`

## Testing

Tests use the VS Code test framework with Mocha. Run tests with `npm run test` which automatically compiles and lints before testing.
